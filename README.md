# Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for data analysis and visualization tasks using popular libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
Each script focuses on a specific aspect of data exploration and visualization, including statistical analysis, clustering, and plotting.

## Contents

- **`data_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for statistical analysis and visualization of numerical features in a dataset.
- **`clustering.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of K-Means clustering algorithm for grouping data points.
- **`visualization_methods.py`**: Python script defining reusable methods for visualizing data using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **`README.md`**: This file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and execute the Jupyter Notebooks (`data_analysis.ipynb` and `clustering.ipynb`) to explore the data and visualize the results.
4. Optionally, you can use the methods defined in `visualization_methods.py` in your own Python scripts for data visualization tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- seaborn
